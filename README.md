# ♟️ Chess Game Implemented by Reinforcement Learning

A deep learning-based project that implements a chess game using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The model learns to play chess through self-play using Q-learning or Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and is capable of making intelligent moves.

## 📌 Features

✅ **Chess Game Simulation** – Implements the rules and logic of chess.  
✅ **Reinforcement Learning** – Uses Q-learning or DQN to train the model to play chess.  
✅ **Self-Play** – The model improves through self-play, learning from each game.  
✅ **Move Prediction** – The trained model predicts the best possible move during the game.  
✅ **Web & Mobile Deployment** – Can be deployed as a web app or integrated into a mobile app.  

## 🖼️ Dataset

This project does not rely on an external dataset but trains the model through self-play, where the agent learns by interacting with the game environment and adjusting based on rewards received.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3.11**
- **TensorFlow/Keras** (for implementing deep Q-networks)
- **OpenAI Gym** (for simulating the chess environment)
- **NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib** (for data manipulation and visualization)
- **Flask/FastAPI** (for API deployment)
- **PyGame/Other Game Libraries** (for game visualization)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1️⃣ **Clone the Repository**  
git clone https://github.com/Abena-3565/Chess-game-implement-by-Reinforcement-learning.git
cd Chess-game-implement-by-Reinforcement-learning
2️⃣ Create Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
3️⃣ Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
4️⃣ Train the Model (Optional)
If you want to retrain the model, run:
python train.py
This will save the model weights as chess_model.h5.
📡 Deployment Options
🌐 Web API (FastAPI)
Run the API locally:
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
Then send a test request:
Edit
curl -X POST -F "game_state=@current_game_state.json" http://127.0.0.1:8000/predict/
📱 Mobile App (TensorFlow Lite)
Convert the model to TFLite format:
tflite_convert --saved_model_dir=chess_model/ --output_file=chess_model.tflite
Integrate it into an Android app using ML Kit.

☁️ Cloud Deployment
Google Cloud Run (for scalable API hosting)
AWS Lambda + API Gateway (serverless API)
Firebase Hosting (for web app)
📌 Example Usage
Using Python:
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import json

# Load the trained model
model = tf.keras.models.load_model("chess_model.h5")

def predict_move(game_state):
    # Convert the game state to a suitable input format for the model
    game_state_array = np.array(game_state).reshape((1, 8, 8, 1))  # Assuming 8x8 board with 1 channel
    prediction = model.predict(game_state_array)
    return prediction

# Example of predicting a move from the current game state (as a JSON)
with open('current_game_state.json', 'r') as f:
    game_state = json.load(f)

print(predict_move(game_state))
